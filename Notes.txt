Possible additional augmentation methods:
	->Erosion and Dilation: These morphological operations can help simulate variations in the hand's edge definitions, which can be affected by video compression artifacts or camera focus issues.
	->Color Perturbation: Even if you convert images to grayscale, slight changes in color (for RGB images before conversion) can help if the model initially trains on RGB images to learn better invariances.

EfficientNetB0_1:
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.05,
    height_shift_range=0.05,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest',
    preprocessing_function=apply_augmentations
)
augmentations: brightness, erosion, dilation
preprocessing: grayscale, resize to 128x128, normalization, no background segmentation
results: 99 percent test score; In real time it fails on G, A, and a few more, but is generally good when the background is neutral; when doing the signs next to body it fails consistently.
